# CryptoClustering
# This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The analysis is conducted on both the original scaled data and the reduced PCA data, comparing the optimal k-values and evaluating the impact of using fewer features for clustering.
# Crypto_Clustering.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
